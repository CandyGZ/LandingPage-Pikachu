# Pikachu Themed Landing Page

## Overview

This project is an interactive Pikachu-themed landing page developed using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The distinctive feature of this page is the inclusion of bouncing balls, representing iconic Pokeballs, behaving based on physics principles such as gravity and bounce factor.

## Key Features

- **Ball Animation**: The balls, symbolizing Pokeballs, fall from the sky to the page floor. This effect is achieved by simulating gravity using JavaScript.

- **Bounce Physics**: Once the balls touch the ground, they start bouncing with a realistic bounce factor. This elastic bounce factor controls the height of each bounce, adding authenticity to the simulation.

- **Natural Stoppage**: The balls eventually come to a natural stop after bouncing several times. This is achieved by considering the velocity and position of the balls in each animation frame.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The page's structure is created using HTML, defining the elements and layout.

- **CSS**: Visual styles and the appearance of the balls are controlled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). A Pikachu theme is also included to give it an appealing look.

- **JavaScript**: The animation logic of the balls is implemented in JavaScript. The simulation of gravity, bounce, and natural stoppage is handled in this programming language.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser to experience the Pikachu landing page. Observe how the balls fall from the sky, bounce, and eventually come to a realistic stop.

## Customization

If you wish to customize this landing page, you can adjust the styles in the CSS file to tailor it to your own preferences. You can also modify the parameters of the ball physics in the JavaScript file to experiment with different behaviors.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to enhance or expand this Pikachu-themed landing page, making the balls rotate or any other upgrade feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.

I hope you enjoy this interactive page and have fun exploring the bouncing Pokeball balls.
